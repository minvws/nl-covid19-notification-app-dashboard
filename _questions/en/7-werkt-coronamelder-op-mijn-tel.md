The app works on 95% of all phones. 

**Android**: The CoronaMelder app works on most Android phones running version 6 or higher.

**iPhone**: The CoronaMelder app works on Apple iPhones running operating system iOS 13.5 or higher. It is possible to install iOS 13.5 on the iPhone 6s, iPhone SE and all newer models.

Apple and Google have both adapted their operating systems so that CoronaMelder can run using Bluetooth Low Energy. Apple only offers this facility in version iOS 13.5 and upwards (iPhone 6s or higher). For iOS 12, security updates are provided but no operational updates. The update policy is determined by Apple Inc. and the Dutch government has no influence over this.
